<b>camClipToggle.py</b>
<br>Increases the clipping plane range of all cameras in the scene to 10cm - 1,000,000cm. Clicking again will toggle all cameras back to default range. Good for working on environments without needing to manually edit clipping plane values.

<b>curveTube.py</b>
<br>If given a curve, curveTube will produce tube geometry with spans at the curve's CVs. If given tube geometry, curveTube will instead create a curve with CVs at the center of each edge ring.

<b>dualToggle.py</b>
<br>When given two selectioned objects, dualToggle will key their visibilities on different frames. For easy comparison between two models. Will also turn off selection highlighting for easier viewing.

<b>faceCut.py</b>
<br>Given a a complete edge loop or enclosure of edges, this script will select all faces within the edge perimeter.

<b>headCut.py</b>
<br>Selected faces or vertices will be ordered to have the first vertex IDs. Used for reordering character models so that the head consists of the first vertIDs.

<b>holeGrid.py</b>
<br>When an edge or edgloop of a hole is selected, this script will fill the hole with a grid. After the script is run, the grid verts are selected for further averaging. The 'offset' attribute in the channel box can be adjusted to fine-tune the rotation.

<b>imagePlaneToggle.py</b>
<br>Toggles imageplane visibility of current camera from 0% to 50% to 100%. Meant to be keybinded to quickly change the alpha of an imageplane without using the slider in the camera's attributes.

<b>jamesTools.py</b>
<br>A UI that contains buttons for all the rest the scripts.

<b>removeNamespaces.py</b>
<br>Removes all namespaces. May need to be run multiple times for stacked namespaces

<b>replaceTopo.py</b>
<br>A UI that allows the user to replace all instances of a geometry in a scene with newer/higher-res geo (even if the old geometry's tranforms have been lost/frozen). An 'Old Mesh' is used as a wrap deformer on the 'New Mesh'. Then that 'Old Mesh' blendshapes
into all the 'Old Targets', leaving a duplicate of 'New Mesh' in that position. Users can choose to put the duplicates into a new group, or replace the existing old meshes.

<b>smartCombine.py</b>
<br>Will combine objects while retaining the pivot, name, hierarchy, and display layer of the last selected object. History is deleted.

<b>smartExtract.py</b>
<br>meant to be a cleaner alternative for Maya's extract
<br>if objects with separate meshes are selected, smartExtract will separate them.
<br>if given a face selection, smartExtract will extract faces but retain the name and pivot of the base geometry. The extracted pieces will be named/numbered and pivots centered.
<br>if given an completed edge loop, smartExtract will run faceCut and then extract faces.
<br>if given vertices, the vertex selection will be converted to a face select and extract.
<br>Also contains <b>smartDuplicate</b>, which can duplicate faces without adding history/garbage to the scene.

<b>unsmooth.py</b>
<br>Unsmooths geometry that has been smoothed, even without history. Works on quad-only geo that has not been edited since the smoothing. singular meshes only.

<b>uvui.py</b>
<br>A custom UV toolset that allows access to the most commonly used tools. Includes better support for flipping UVs within the UDIM.
